今天给大家分享一下两种特殊的方便面吃法
第一种：
    白糖拌面
    使用开水把面泡熟，然后把水倒出，只留面。加入白糖和少量调料包，完成。
    我小学的时候经常这样吃面，小时候经常自己在家，不敢煮面，也不喜欢汤，最终发明了这种吃法
第二种：
    方便面拌盒饭
    我初三的时候，最后的几个月，因为要考高中，学校会组织上晚自习。所以下午下课之后，大家要吃晚饭。通常我们会买盒饭。但是我当时正值青春年少，一盒盒饭不够吃，通常会再买包方便面。盒饭剩一半的时候，把方便面捏成小块，拌到饭菜里。方便面香脆，米饭软糯，可以体会到一种奇妙的快乐。
    谢谢大家，这就是我今天的分享，感兴趣的同学可以试试这两种吃法。

Today I will share with you two special ways to make instant(/ˈɪnstənt/) noodles
First one:
    Instant noodles mixed with Sugar
    Use boiling water to soak the noodles, then pour out the water, leaving only the noodles. Add sugar and a small amount of seasoning(/ˈsiːzənɪŋ/) packet, done.
    When I was in primary school, I used to eat noodles like this. When I was young, I used to be at home by myself. I didn’t dare to cook noodles and didn’t like soup. I finally invented this way.
Second one:
    Instant noodles mixed with boxed meals
    When I was in the third year of junior high school, in the last few months, because I had to take the high school entrance examination, the school organized evening self-study. So after class in the afternoon, everyone will have dinner. Usually we buy boxed meals. However, when I was young, and a box of lunch is not enough, so I usually buy another package of instant noodles. When half of the box meals is left, knead(/niːd/ ) the instant noodles into small pieces and mix them into the meal. The instant noodles are crispy and the rice is soft. You can experience a wonderful happiness.
    Thank you everyone. This is what I have shared today. Interested students can try these two ways of eating.
